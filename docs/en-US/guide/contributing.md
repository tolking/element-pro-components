# Contributing Guide

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- Before submitting an issue, please check if similar problems have already been issued.
- Before submitting an issue, please describe the problem in short words, and add the environment and recurrence steps when the issue occurs.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers.
- When in doubt, keep your pull requests small. To give a PR the best chance of getting accepted, don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per pull request. It's always best to create two smaller PRs than one big one.
- When adding new features or modifying existing, please attempt to include tests to confirm the new behavior.

- Rebase before creating a PR to keep commit history clear.
- Add some descriptions and refer relative issues for you PR.

```
/^(revert: )?(feat|fix|docs|dx|style|refactor|perf|test|workflow|build|ci|chore|types|wip)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}/
